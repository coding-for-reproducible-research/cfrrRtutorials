<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to Improve Your R Code! R is primarily known as a language
and environment for statistical computing and graphics. However, the
flexibility and accessibility of R has led to its popularity across a
diverse range of disciplines including biosciences, medicine and, of
course, statistics. This workshop aims to extend your existing knowledge
of R, enabling you to improve the <strong>style</strong> and the
<strong>speed</strong> of your R code. The material for this workshop
was created by Conor Crilly.</p>
<div id="section-course-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of the session you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to write clean, readable, and maintainable R code following
the tidyverse style guide.</li>
<li>Be able to accurately measure the speed of your code using
<code>microbenchmark</code>.</li>
<li>Be comfortable with built-in R functions and packages
(e.g. <code>parallel</code>, <code>data.table</code>, <code>Rcpp</code>)
for improving execution speed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introduction to Coding For Reproducible Research</h3>
<p>This workshop is offered as part of the <a
href="https://uniexeterrse.github.io/workshop-homepage/">Coding For
Reproducible Research Intiative</a>. Our ambition is to offer a
recurring annual series of workshops open to all staff and students,
with opportunities for novices through to more experienced users, to
expand their skillsets and position them to confidently perform the
informatics research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. A
key objective is that the framework we put in place ensures that the
workshops delivered are fit for purpose, of a consistent high standard,
that delivery is sustainable in the longer term, minimises the workload
burden on those who facilitate them and can adapt and expand as new
training needs are identified.</p>
<p>Championed by and in partnership with</p>
<ul>
<li>Research Software Engineering group</li>
<li>Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI)</li>
<li>Researcher Development (Doctoral College and ECRs)</li>
<li>Reproducibility Network Institutional Leadership team</li>
<li>Exeter Health Analytics Research Network</li>
</ul>
<p>This workshop, and the others in the series, were put together by a
series of working groups formed by researchers from across the
University supported by Exeter’s Research Software Engineering Group.
The programme and workshops are under constant evolution. We appreciate
your patience as we develop and test these materials and are grateful
for your feedback which is a core component of this process. We also
need to maintain accurate records of how many participants we have
reached, so ask you to mark your attendance on the collaborative
document.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-workshop-format" class="section level3">
<h3>Workshop format</h3>
<p>Today’s workshop is led by Conor Crilly and supported by Michelle
Ledbetter and Craig Willis. We are all here because we are passionate
about sharing our knowledge and supporting the development of our
colleagues. For most of us, this is not a requirement of our current
position and we are doing this at the margins of our time.</p>
<p>This workshop contains both live demonstrations of R code and
exercises for you to complete.</p>
<p>Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group. Therefore,
think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict timetable. We
welcome questions and queries as we go along, there are helpers in the
room so raise your hand if you need assistance.</p>
<p>We would like to highlight that we have a <a
href="https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-to-r/code.html">code of
conduct</a> and by attending this workshop you are agreeing to abide by
it.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-pre-requisite-knowledge" class="section level3">
<h3>Pre-requisite Knowledge</h3>
<p>This course will not include an introduction to R, or how to setup
and use R or Rstudio. It is assumed you are comfortable coding in R and
are familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing and executing commands in the R console.</li>
<li>Writing functions in R.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not we recommend that you consult our pre-requisite course
<strong>Introduction to R</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-course-notes" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Notes</h3>
<p>This tutorial contains the course notes, example code snippets plus
explanations, exercises for you to try with solutions and quiz questions
to test your knowledge. Attending a workshop on this topic means there
are people on hand to help if you have any questions or issues with the
materials. However, these have also been designed such that you should
also be able to work through them independently.</p>
<p>You can navigate through the sections using the menu on the side. The
sections on speed are based on <a

<h2>Style Guides and Linters</h2>
<div id="section-the-tidyverse-style-guide" class="section level3">
<h3>The Tidyverse Style Guide</h3>
<p>A style guide is a set of rules that embed consistency into your
code. One such set of rules are contained in the <a
href="https://style.tidyverse.org/">Tidyverse Style Guide</a><a
href="#section-fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="section-fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. These rules are essentially just
<em>opinions</em>, since there are no hard-and-fast rules to the way you
write your code, and there are many different style guides available. We
have chosen to discuss the Tidyverse style guide because of its
popularity. We could not feasibly cover every point in the Tidyverse
Style Guide within this session, but we hope to emphasise some of the
main points and tie them together with an example so you can bring the
ideas back to your own code after the session. Complete details can be
found in the <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/">style guide</a>.</p>
<p>Being conscious of consistency in your code can go a long way in
improving the ease of collaboration and thus the impact of your code on
your research. We will approach consistency from three levels of
increasing granularity:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>File name</li>
<li>Structure implemented within a file</li>
<li>Syntax used within file</li>
</ol>
<div class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-section">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="section-fn1"><p>Note, our course ‘Working With Data in R’ covers
the main functionality of the Tidyverse.<a href="#section-fnref1"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-file-naming-and-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>File Naming and Structure</h3>
<p>The first very simple, yet very important, aspect of an R file is its
name. When naming your file you should:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Give your file a descriptive name</li>
<li>Give your file the extension .R (not .r)</li>
<li>Avoid whitespace.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose we have a script that fits a linear model; calling this file
<code>some file.r</code> violates all of the above. Naming the file
<code>fit-linear-model.R</code> will make it much easier to locate.</p>
<p>If you have a sequence of files that are intended to be run in a
specific order, number them to indicate this. For example,
<code>01-exploratory-analysis.R</code>, <code>02-fit-models.R</code>,
<code>03-plot-results.R</code>.</p>
<p>If you have to import a set of libraries, do so at the beginning of
the file using <code>library()</code> as opposed to loading them
sporadically throughout the file.</p>
<p>Often, using comments such as
<code># ---------- ... ------------</code> can be useful to increase
readability and indicate what the purpose of each sub-section in the
script is doing. For example, one way of organising a small script could
be as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># ---------- loading libraries ---------


# ---------- defining functions --------


# ---------- performing analysis -------


# ---------- saving and plotting results ------------</code></pre>
<p>Note, in R using the ‘project’ structure (add link) or even creating
your own R package (add link) can be useful for more involved analyses,
though we do not cover those topics here.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-file-syntax" class="section level3">
<h3>File Syntax</h3>
<div id="section-variables-and-functions" class="section level4">
<h4>Variables and Functions</h4>
<p>Naming conventions extend from the file itself to the variables,
functions and classes in your code; these should be consistent.</p>
<p>Variable and function names should only contain lowercase letters,
numbers and underscores. In particular, names should not contain white
space. If a variable name contains multiple words, separate them using
underscores. For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># good
string_one &lt;-  &quot;hello world!&quot;

# bad
StringOne &lt;-  &quot;hello world!&quot;

# bad
stringone &lt;-  &quot;hello world!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Also, <em>never</em> use the names of built in functions or variables
e.g. <code>T</code>, <code>mean</code>, <code>pi</code>,
<code>sum</code> etc.</p>
<div id="section-assignment" class="section level5">
<h5>Assignment</h5>
<p>Use <code>&lt;-</code> for assignment instead of <code>=</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># good
greeting &lt;- &quot;hello&quot; 

# bad
greeting = &quot;hello&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-horizontal-spacing" class="section level4">
<h4>Horizontal Spacing</h4>
<p>Commas: space as you would in normal English i.e. a space after, and
only after, the comma.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># bad
ones_matrix &lt;- matrix( 1, 10 ,10 )
ones_matrix[ , 1]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># good
twos_matrix &lt;- matrix(2, 10, 10)
twos_matrix[, 1]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</code></pre>
<p>Parentheses: avoid spaces before and after parentheses in function
calls, but do include them before and after conditional statements.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>word_print_bad &lt;- function (word) {
  if(word){
    print( word ) 
  }
}

word_print_good &lt;- function(word) {
  if (word) {
    print(word) 
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-vertical-spacing" class="section level4">
<h4>Vertical Spacing</h4>
<p>Excessive whitespace should be avoided, but no whitespace at all is
equally as bad. The style guide suggests the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid empty lines at the start or end of functions.</li>
<li>Only use a single empty line when needed to separate functions or
pipes.</li>
<li>It often makes sense to put an empty line before a comment block, to
help visually connect the explanation with the code that it applies
to.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-functions" class="section level4">
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>Functions are an integral part of R.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-control-flow" class="section level4">
<h4>Control Flow</h4>
</div>
<div id="section-exercise" class="section level4">
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>Consider the following two versions of R code that perform the same
task. Discuss in groups what is good about each implementation and what
could be improved.</p>

<div id="section-the-styler-package" class="section level3">
<h3>The Styler package</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-measuring-speed-with-microbenchmark"
class="section level2">
<h2>Measuring Speed with Microbenchmark</h2>
<p>One way of measuring the time taken to run an R function is to invoke
the <code>Sys.time()</code> function from the <code>base</code> R
package. Consider the following toy function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sleep &lt;- function(sleep_time, print_string = FALSE) {
  # type checking
  stopifnot(typeof(sleep_time) == &quot;double&quot;, sleep_time &gt;= 0)
  
  # sleeping
  Sys.sleep(sleep_time)
  
  # print a string if print_string is TRUE
  if (print_string) 
  {
    print(&quot;I am awake now&quot;)
  }
  
}</code></pre>
<p>This function takes an input variable called <code>sleep_time</code>,
checks that <code>sleep_time</code> is a positive number, pauses
execution for <code>sleep_time</code> seconds, then prints “I am awake
now” to the console. Naturally, the functions you may work with are more
interesting than this simple toy function, but it remains useful from a
pedagogical perspective. Suppose we want to time this function using
<code>Sys.time()</code>, we can do so as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t_start &lt;- Sys.time()
sleep(5)
t_end &lt;- Sys.time()

t_end - t_start</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Time difference of 5.007596 secs</code></pre>
<p>The above code times the execution of <code>sleep()</code> exactly
once. Due to uncontrollable variations the time taken to run a function
will not be exactly the same every time we run it. Hence, we may want to
run the function many times to get an idea of the distribution of its
run time. To do so we could perform the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Run the function n_runs times and report the average time
n_runs &lt;- 10
sleep_time &lt;- 0.1
time_taken &lt;- system.time(replicate(n_runs, sleep(sleep_time)))
avg_time &lt;- time_taken[&quot;elapsed&quot;] / n_runs
avg_time</code></pre>
<pre><code>## elapsed 
##  0.1044</code></pre>
<p>The <code>microbenchmark()</code> function included in the
<code>microbenchmark</code> package provides a more accurate
alternative. From the description in the documentation, see
<code>?microbenchmark</code>, <code>microbenchmark</code> does the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tries hard to accurately measure only the time take to evaluate the
function.</li>
<li>Uses sub-millisecond timing functions built into your OS for
increased accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s try it out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># benchmark sleep(0.1) ten times and report the results in nanoseconds
results &lt;- microbenchmark(sleep(0.1), times = 100, unit = &#39;ns&#39;)
results_summary &lt;- summary(results)
results_summary$min/1e9</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.09860008</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>results_summary$mean/1e9</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.1029018</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>results_summary$max/1e9</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.1034885</code></pre>
<p>The <code>microbenchmark</code> function provides additional
information over the approaches above, including the minimum, maximum
and mean evaluation time. Let’s plot a histogram of the results.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(results$time/1e9, xlab = &quot;Time (s)&quot;, main = &quot;Histogram of Microbenchmark Results&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="section-overview-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>R is an interpreted language, meaning it is not compiled into machine
code before execution like in C or C++. If you really want to dig into
the difference, you could start with <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3265357/compiled-vs-interpreted-languages">this
thread</a>. If you don’t know what this means, don’t panic. All we need
to know is that loops, especially <strong>nested</strong> loops are
typically slow in interpreted languages. That is, they should be avoided
if possible in R.</p>
<p>Although vectorising your code is more than just avoiding loops, one
aspect of vectorisation <strong>is</strong> avoiding loops. In
particular, I mean avoiding loops of R code. One way of avoiding loops
in R is through vectorized functions, which have their loops implemented
in C under-the-hood. A vectorized function operates on every element of
the vector at once, avoiding looping through the vector, in R, and
operating element-by-element. By exploiting vectorization we can
potentially write <strong>faster</strong> R code, and it is almost
certain you have been doing this without even knowing!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-examples" class="section level3">
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Suppose we want to calculate the cumulative sum of a vector <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. We could write a function in
<code>R</code> using a for loop as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cumsum_R &lt;- function(x) {
  len_x &lt;- length(x)
  
  # best pracitce to initialise a vector of known length, rather than append
  out &lt;- numeric(len_x)
  
  curr_total &lt;- 0
  
  for (i in 1:len_x) {
    curr_total &lt;- curr_total + x[i]
    out[i] &lt;- curr_total
  }
  
  out
  
}

cumsum_R(1:10)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  1  3  6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55</code></pre>
<p>In R there is a built in function called <code>cumsum()</code> that
can do this for us. You can view the documentation by executing
<code>?cumsum()</code> in your session, and you will see there are
additional members of this family e.g. <code>cumprod()</code>. By
executing <code>cumsum</code> <strong>without brackets</strong> in your
session you can see that the <code>cumsum()</code> function is calling
<code>.Primitive</code>; this means that R is calling a function which
is implemented entirely in C, so it is going to be
<strong>fast</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cumsum</code></pre>
<pre><code>## function (x)  .Primitive(&quot;cumsum&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s compare our own naive implementation against the
<code>cumsum()</code> function provided in the <code>base</code> R
package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>test_x &lt;- 1:1000
results &lt;- microbenchmark(cumsum(test_x), cumsum_R(test_x))
summary(results)</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">

<h2>Fast Data Manipulation Using the <code>data.table</code>
Package</h2>
<div id="section-overview-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The <code>data.table</code> package is designed specifically for
efficient manipulation of large datasets. The introductory vignette
accompanying the <code>data.table</code> package states the
following:</p>
<p><strong>“… if you are interested in reducing programming and compute
time tremendously, then this package is for you.”</strong></p>
<p>In research we often deal with large datasets, so this package merits
further investigation! We closely follow the aforementioned vignette in
this section, which you can view by executing
<code>vignette("datatable-intro", package = "data.table")</code> in your
R session.</p>
<p>It is likely that when analysing your data you structure your
workflow as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You read the data.</li>
<li>You analyse the data e.g. cleaning, grouping, aggregating, filtering
etc.</li>
<li>You write the results to a file and maybe send them to a
collaborator.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>data.table</code> package speeds up
<strong>reading</strong> and <strong>writing</strong> using the
following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading using <code>fread</code>. <strong>Similar to
<code>read.csv()</code> and <code>read.delim()</code> but faster and
more convenient.</strong></li>
<li>Writing using <code>fwrite</code>. <strong>As write.csv but much
faster (e.g. 2 seconds versus 1 minute) and just as
flexible.</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- Note, for a function named `my_function()`, the description of the function can be obtained by typing `?my_function()`. -->
<p>The following code uses <code>fread</code> to read data stored in a
csv file from the <code>data.table</code> GitHub repository. We will
work with this dataset throughout this section. It contains On-Time
flights data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics for all the
flights that departed from New York City airports in 2014. The data is
available only for Jan 2014 - October 14.</p>

<p>Note, <code>fread</code> returns a <code>data.table</code> object by
default, otherwise a <code>data.frame</code> with the argument
<code>data.table=FALSE</code>.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>OK, so points 1. and 3. above can be accelerated pretty easily using
<code>fread</code> and <code>fwrite</code>, but how can we accelerate
our analysis? The purpose of this section is to introduce the basic
syntax of the <code>data.table</code> object for speeding up our
analysis (i.e. point 2 above).</p>
<p>In base R, the standard way of storing data is in a
<code>data.frame</code>. If you attended our ‘Working With Data in R’
course, one of the motivating factors for using the Tidyverse
functionality was that Tidyverse functions were designed with consistent
interfaces, meaning the functions accept a <code>data.frame</code>
object as an input and return a <code>data.frame</code> object as an
output. The <code>data.table</code> package provides an enhanced version
of the <code>data.frame</code> object.</p>
<p>If not reading the data in using <code>fread</code>, a
<code>data.table</code> can be created from scratch as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>DT &lt;- data.table(x = rnorm(200),
                    y = rnorm(200),
                    z = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>The general form of the <code>data.table</code> syntax is as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>DT[ i,  j,  by ] # + extra arguments
    |   |   |
    |   |    -------&gt; grouped by what?
    |    -------&gt; what to do?
     ---&gt; on which rows?
     </code></pre>
<p>We should interpret this as “Take <code>DT</code>, subset/reorder
rows using <code>i</code>, then calculate <code>j</code>, grouped by
<code>by</code>.”</p>
<div id="section-selecting-row-and-columns" class="section level4">
<h4>Selecting Row and Columns</h4>
<p>To subsetting our data, we use the <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>
arguments within <code>DT[i, j, by]</code>.</p>
<p>Using <code>j</code> to select columns is analogous to
<code>dplyr::select()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># return as vector
flights[, dep_delay]

#  return as data.table
flights[, .(dep_delay)]
#             &lt;int&gt;
#      1:        14
#      2:        -3
#      3:         2
#      4:        -8
#      5:         2
#     ---          
# 253312:         1
# 253313:        -5
# 253314:        -8
# 253315:        -4
# 253316:        -5</code></pre>
<p>Note, the <code>.()</code> notation is an alias for
<code>list()</code> here.</p>
<p>Columns name in a variable can also be selected using
<code>..</code>. Here, the <code>..</code> with <code>[]</code> is

<div id="section-updating-and-removing-columns" class="section level4">
<h4>Updating and Removing Columns</h4>
<p>Adding columns can be achieved using the <code>:=</code> operator.
This adds columns ‘by reference’, meaning the <code>data.table</code> is
never copied. To illustrate this, consider the following smaller
examples:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_dt &lt;- data.table(x = rnorm(200))
tracemem(my_dt)
# [1] &quot;&lt;0x12e44c600&gt;&quot;

my_dt[, z := rnorm(200)]
tracemem(my_dt)
# [1] &quot;&lt;0x12e44c600&gt;&quot;

my_df &lt;- data.frame(x = rnorm(200))
tracemem(my_df)
# [1] &quot;&lt;0x12e2b6f98&gt;&quot;

my_df &lt;- my_df %&gt;%
  mutate(z = rnorm(200))
tracemem(my_df)
# [1] &quot;&lt;0x10d78b288&gt;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>With the <code>data.table</code>, using <code>:=</code> within the
frame <code>[ ... ]</code> is sufficient to add a new column to the
<code>data.table</code>; we didn’t have to assign the result back to
<code>my_dt</code> using <code>&lt;-</code>. Note, the
<code>tracemem()</code> function shows the addresses are the same for
the <code>my_dt</code> example, so a copy was not made. However, for the
<code>my_df</code> example, this was not the case. Much more detail on
this behaviour is available in <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-reference-semantics.html">this
vignette</a>.</p>
<p>Removing a column, by reference, can also be achieved using
<code>:=</code></p>

<p><em>Chaining</em> In the above example where we found the number of

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Suppose you have found yourself in one of the following
situations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You have a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that you
need to run <strong>many</strong> times for different input values.</li>
<li>You have a large set of functions <span class="math inline">\(f_1,
\, \dots\, , f_n\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(n&gt;&gt;1\)</span>, that you need to run, each
for potentially many different input values.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re like me, you’d probably prefer to get straight to analyzing
the data produced by the functions as opposed to waiting around all day
for them to finish running. This is where parallelization can help
you.</p>
<p>We consider the case here where each function evaluation is
completely independent of the others. In case 1 above, this is trivial
because you’re just running the same function for many different input
combinations. In the second scenario, this means that the functions are
completely unrelated e.g. the output of one function is never used as
the input to another.</p>
<p>A core on your computer can be thought of as an individual unit that
can execute tasks. The vast majority of modern computers have multiple
cores and parallelising your code involves sending independent jobs to
different cores on your computer. In <code>R</code> one way of doing
this is by using a concept called <strong>forking</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-forking-will-not-work-on-windows"
class="section level3">
<h3>Forking (Will not work on Windows)</h3>
<p>Forking in <code>R</code> can be achieved using the
<code>parallel</code> package, but first you should check that forking
is actually supported within the environment in which you are developing
your <code>R</code> code. Do do this, you can use the
<code>supportsMulticore()</code> function from the
<code>parallelly</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>supportsMulticore() </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<p>In RStudio, depending on the version, the above may return
<code>FALSE</code>, meaning forking is <strong>NOT</strong> supported,
so you <strong>may</strong> not see any performance enhancements by
using forking when running scripts in RStudio. Note I said
<strong>may</strong>; as we will see below, using functions from the
<code>parallel</code> package in Rstudio appear to behave well. However
it is highly discouraged as the behaviour can be unexpected.</p>
<p>The advised way to use forking is to run <code>R</code> scripts using
your terminal. Suppose you have a script called
<code>my-script.R</code>. There are two ways to use your terminal to run
<code>my-script.R</code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Initiate an R session directly in the terminal, in the same
directory as <code>my-script.R</code>, by typing <code>R</code>. Within
the session type <code>source("my-script.R")</code></li>
<li>Execute <code>my-script.R</code> directly using the
<code>Rscript</code> command in your terminal, i.e. by typing
<code>Rscript my-script.R</code></li>

<h3>Forking - <code>mclapply()</code></h3>
<p>First, let’s detect the number of cores available on our machine
using <code>detectCores()</code> from the <code>parallel</code>
package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>num_cores &lt;- detectCores()
num_cores</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 12</code></pre>
<p>On my machine, this returns 12, though on yours it may return
something different. The output of <code>detectCores()</code> provides a
useful guide on deciding how many cores to parallelise across, which can
be specified in the <code>mclapply()</code> via the
<code>mc.cores</code> argument. There are several important points
here:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A value of two or greater for <code>mc.cores</code> is necessary for
parallelisation. Setting <code>mc.cores = 1</code> will disable
parallelisation.</li>
<li>It is not the case that choosing <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> cores will result in a speed up of a
factor of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</li>
<li>Setting <code>mc.cores</code> higher than the number of available
cores can actually slow down your code due to the overhead it creates.
Using <code>detectCores()/2</code> is a useful starting point, and you
can experiment from there.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s see <code>mclapply()</code> in action. Consider the
following toy function, similar to the, which is used simply to
represent an expensive function</p>
<pre class="r"><code>slow_function &lt;- function(n) {
  Sys.sleep(1)

<p>Run using the regular <code>lapply()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>is &lt;- 1:24
t1 &lt;- system.time(lapply(is, slow_function))[&quot;elapsed&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Run using parallelisation with <code>mclapply()</code> with four
cores:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t4 &lt;- system.time(mclapply(is, slow_function, mc.cores = 4))[&quot;elapsed&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Run using parallelisation with <code>mclapply()</code> with eight
cores:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t8 &lt;- system.time(mclapply(is, slow_function, mc.cores = 8))[&quot;elapsed&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Run using parallelisation with <code>mclapply()</code> with twelve
cores:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t12 &lt;- system.time(mclapply(is, slow_function, mc.cores = 12))[&quot;elapsed&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Plot the results</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ts &lt;- c(t1, t4, t8, t12)

<div id="section-overview-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language that
extends C with object-oriented, generic, and functional programming
features. If you don’t know what those are, or have never used C++
before, do not worry. For us the most important point to note is that it
can provide a <strong>fast</strong> alternative to R and can be
integrated into our R code. In fact, under the hood, many of the base R
functions are themselves written in C. In addition, many R packages on
CRAN contain functions written in C++.</p>
<p>The easiest way to use C++ code in an R environment is through the
Rcpp package. On MacOS and Linux systems, the Rcpp package is likely to
be setup and loaded correctly after executing
<code>install.packages('Rcpp')</code>, followed by
<code>library(Rcpp)</code>. On a windows OS, you may need to follow the
instructions <a

<h3>Example: Estimating Pi</h3>
<p>Suppose we want to estimate the value of pi. One way of doing this is
to use Monte Carlo sampling.</p>
<p>Consider a quarter-circle of radius 1 inside the unit square <span

quarter-circle is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x^2 + y^2 \leq 1

<p>Since the area of the full circle is <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, the quarter-circle has an area of
<span class="math inline">\(\pi/4\)</span>. By randomly sampling points
inside the square and checking how many fall inside the quarter-circle,
we can estimate <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> using:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\pi \approx 4 \times \frac{M}{N}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the number of points
inside the quarter-circle, and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is
the total number of points sampled.</p>
<p>We can plot this set-up:</p>
<p><img src="Improve-Your-R-Code_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-43-1.png" width="576" /></p>
<p>An implementation of this procedure in R is as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pi_R &lt;- function(n) {
  
  # we want n points, each point is in 2D space, so we need to sample m = 2*n
  # points using runif()
  m &lt;-  2*n
  
  # get m samples - each sample is a row of the matrix 
  samples &lt;- runif(m) |&gt;
    matrix(ncol = 2)
  
  # how many lie inside the quarter circle?
  # get the distance between each row and the origin (0,0)
  n_inside_circle &lt;- sum(sqrt(rowSums(samples^2)) &lt; 1)
  
  # estimate pi by multiplying the proportion of points inside the quarter
  # circle by 4
  pi_estimate &lt;- (n_inside_circle/n) * 4
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can run the function for increasing <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, which should converge to the true
value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Estimates for different n
pi_estimate_1 &lt;- pi_R(1)
pi_estimate_10 &lt;- pi_R(10)
pi_estimate_100 &lt;- pi_R(100)
pi_estimate_1000 &lt;- pi_R(1000)
pi_estimate_10000 &lt;- pi_R(10000)

pi_vec &lt;- c(pi_estimate_1,
            pi_estimate_10,
            pi_estimate_100,
            pi_estimate_1000,
            pi_estimate_10000)

print(pi_vec)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4.0000 2.8000 3.2800 3.1400 3.1608</code></pre>
<p>We can also plot the estimates, and compare them to the value of
<span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> contained in <code>R</code>,
which is accessible through <code>pi</code> and is denoted by the dashed
horizontal line.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(c(1,10,100,1000, 10000), 
     pi_vec, 
     type =&#39;b&#39;, 
     pch = 20,
     xlab = &quot;Number of Samples&quot;,
     ylab = &quot;Estimate&quot;)
abline(h = pi, col = 4, lty = 2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Improve-Your-R-Code_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Suppose we want to do the same in C++. We can write the C++ code in a
seperate file with a <code>.cpp</code>, then call it within
<code>R</code> using the <code>sourceCpp()</code> function provided in
the <code>Rcpp</code> package. For completeness, the C++ source code
contained in the file <code>pi.cpp</code> is as follows:</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code>#include &quot;Rcpp.h&quot; 

using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
double pi_cpp(int n) {
  int count_inside = 0;
  
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
    double x = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(rand()) / RAND_MAX;
    double y = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(rand()) / RAND_MAX;
    
    if (std::sqrt(x * x + y * y) &lt; 1) {
      count_inside++;
    }
  }
  
  return (static_cast&lt;double&gt;(count_inside) / n) * 4.0;
}</code></pre>
<p>Loading the function into <code>R</code> is as simple as calling
<code>sourceCpp()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sourceCpp(&quot;pi.cpp&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We can now run the function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pi_cpp(10000)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.1308</code></pre>
<p>Finally, let’s compare it with the <code>R</code> implementation
using <code>microbencmark</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>results &lt;- microbenchmark(pi_R(1e6), pi_cpp(1e6))
summary(results)</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
